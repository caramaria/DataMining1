\section{Structure and Size of Data}
In this project, which focusses on soccer analytics, the FIFA 19 dataset from kaeggle is used. It includes information about every player who is registered to the sofifa database \cite{ref_sofifa}. 
The database includes more than 18207 registered players, for each player 86 different attributes are available. The attributes can be grouped in the following 10 groups: 
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Personal information

	\item Mental Capabilities
	\item Sports and Soccer Statistics
	\item Attacking Statistics  
	\item Skill Statistics
	\item Defending Statistics

	\item Goalkeeping Statistics
\item Strength Statistics
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

The table below contains the attributes for each group:

In the dataset one player is assigned to exactly one position out of 25 available positions. As players might play on different positions during a season or training, the potential for 24 positions (except goalkeeper position) is recognized as well in the dataset. The position is written down as abbreviation meaning:

These position potentials are not applied for goalkeepers.
Not all the attributes have filled values. 
One reason for this is that that not every player is loaned from another club. Other reason for the missing information is that some players are young and not every information is yet collected. Analyzing the data set showed that there are 48 players were only key attributes like personal information are provided. \newline
Attributes of the statistical groups are continuous data with a range from 0 to 100. Other attributes are categorical data. Furthermore the data set includes numerical attributes like wage, release clause, weight and height. \newline
\textit{The wage and release clauses starts from a value of 1000 while the specialty attribute is not smaller than 731. }
