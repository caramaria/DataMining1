\subsection{Evaluation setup and results}
\label{sec:Evaluation}

The perfect classification of goalkeepers can be justified by strength and weaknesses of these football positions. Goalkeepers have low values regarding sliding tackle, skill moves, sprint speed, etc. A visualization in a coordination systems \ref{fig:VisualAttributes} shows that goalkeepers have the biggest deficits in these and other attributes (values in the bottom left corner). While midfielder and strikers have nearly same strengths (one dot on top of each other in middle and top right corner).
