\section{Data Mining}

To identify the best classification algorithm different available operators were used in Rapidminer.
First runs per algorithm were executed using the cross-validation operator. After recall, precision and accuracy scores were available the second phase began. During this phase different approaches are used to maximize the prediction result and finetune the performance scores based on the best suited algorithm identified in phase 1. In a third phase a new test data set were applied based on data from 2018 to check of overfitted models. \newline

In the following sections the different algorithms and their results of phase 1 are described. 
Afterwards in section \ref{sec:Evaluation} results are evaluated.
Finally, a discussion of results is written down in section \ref{sec:DiscussionResults}.
