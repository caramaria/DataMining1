%transformation of data

Not all 83 attributes are necessary to predict the position of a player.
We applied the optimize selection operator and analyzed the log reports from Rapidminer to select the important attributes.
During one run the attributes Sliding tackle, Skill move, Long passing, LCB (Left center back), Heading accuracy, LAM (Left attacking midfield), Finishing, Crossing, Sprint speed and LB (left back) were rated with a relative importance. With no influence the other playing position results were weighted. \newline

Attributes marked as personal and contract information were excluded from the dataset as they are not relevant to determine players position. 
The data mining processes started with a higher aggregation of players position which results in four groups: defender, midfielder, strikers and goalkeepers. The following concrete positions were grouped together in an attribute called Position\_grouped replacing the original position attribute:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Strikers
\begin{itemize}
\item "ST", "CF", "LF", "LS", "LW", "RF", "RS" and "RW"
\end{itemize}
\item Midfielder
\begin{itemize}
\item "CAM", "CDM", "LCM", "CM", "LAM", "LDM", "LM", "RAM", "RCM", "RD", "RM"
\end{itemize}
\item Defender
\begin{itemize} 
\item "CB", "LB", "LCB", "LWB", "RB", "RCB", "RWB"
\end{itemize}
\item Goalkeeper
\begin{itemize}
\item "GK"
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

After this aggregration 6838 midfielders, 2025 goalkeepers, 5866 defender and 3418 strikers (total 18147) are used to train and test the model.
During the data mining process a second dataset was prepared to test data and a potential overfit of the model. The test data set based on FIFA data from 2017 included 7086 midfielders, 1997 goalkeeper, 5363 defenders and 3293 srikers (total 17739).

The attributes release clause and wage are reported in a format including k (thousand) and m (million). These values have been converted. The height is converted from foot into centimeter. The weight has been recalculated from pound into kilogram.  For the attributes height and weight zero values are entered if not information is available and needed to be filtered out. The attribute preferred foot converted into a binominal value, meaning 0 for right and 1 for left.
