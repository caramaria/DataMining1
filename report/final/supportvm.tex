\subsection{Support Vector Machines}
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a linear model for classification and regression problems. The SVM Linear takes a set of input data and predicts, for each given input, which of the two possible classes comprises the input, making the SVM a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier \cite{ref_rapidminersvm}.
We use cross validation for estimating statistical performance, classification by regression to build a polynomial classification model through regression learner and SVM linear to build a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other.\\
 A change in the value of the parameter C of SVM, which is the complexity constant, sets the tolerance for misclassification in its parameters where higher C values allow for `softer' boundaries and lower values create `harder' boundaries \cite{ref_rapidminersvm}.  A complexity constant that is large will lead to overfitting and values that are too small may result in over-generalization.\\
The algorithm looks at the extreme cases and draws a decision boundary known as hyperplane. The result from the optimization provides C for SVM Linear with the best value of 1.0. 
Training SVM on the FIFA 2019 dataset, as shown in the table 8, leads to an the overall accuracy of 85.06\%. The best performing class is goalkeeper with 99.95\% accuracy and the worst performing class is strikers with 79.65\% accuracy. Precision and recall of the training set are 86.44\% and 87.87\% respectively. 
Applying the model to the test data set provides an overall accuracy of 83,74\% as shown in table 8. The best performing class is Goalkeeper with 100\% accuracy and the worst performing class is Striker with 76.10\% accuracy. The precision and recall of the test set obtained are 85.42\% and 85.76\% respectively.
